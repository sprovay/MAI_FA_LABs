This is a simple test file to check the text formatting functionality. The program should break long lines at word boundaries and distribute spaces evenly between words to reach the 80-character limit. Short lines should remain unchanged.
Multiple paragraphs should be handled correctly. Empty lines should be preserved as well.
Let's test some edge cases: verylongwordthatexceedsthelinelimitbutshouldbekepttogether, normal words, and combinations of different word lengths.



Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is a very long word that should be kept intact even if it exceeds 80 characters. Similarly, pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is another extremely long word that tests the program's ability to handle words longer than the line limit.
This line contains a mix of short words and verylongwordwithoutspacesthatmightcauseproblemsifnothandledcorrectly by the formatting algorithm.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This sentence contains all letters of the English alphabet and is useful for testing text formatting algorithms. When broken into multiple lines, the spaces should be distributed evenly to create visually appealing paragraphs.
In computer programming, text formatting is an important task that involves adjusting the layout of text to meet specific requirements. The algorithm must consider word boundaries, punctuation, and readability while maintaining the original content.
Testing edge cases is crucial for robust software. Consider lines with varying word lengths, special characters, and different spacing patterns to ensure comprehensive coverage.
